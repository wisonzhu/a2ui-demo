/**
 * Pure function that acts as a generic container for A2UI components.
 *
 * It dynamically resolves and renders the specific Lit component implementation
 * based on the component type provided in the context, returning a TemplateResult directly
 * to avoid duplicate DOM node wrapping.
 *
 * @param context The component context defining the data model and type to render.
 * @param catalog The catalog of component implementations.
 * @returns A Lit TemplateResult representing the resolved component, or `nothing` if the component is invalid or unresolvable.
 *
 * This method should be used directly very rarely. Instead, programmers should use
 * the `renderNode` method on the base `A2uiLitElement` class, which handles context
 * creation automatically.
